# IC Control tech test

Tech test for IC Control:

Your task is to present .json-data as buttons and their attributes. Focus on tooling, ui and when the user clicks a button it should console-log which button that was clicked.

My take on it:

I used react as my main "tool" to make a nice, fast web-app. I added some extra functionality by adding
a toggle to switch between the two datasets, the toggle also change images depending on dataset.

Its fast, clean and of course responsive.
